Data have been extracted from [1], where authors identified and quantified proteins expressed in each of the 14 segments of rat kidney tubules and used the proteomic data that they obtained to create an online information resource, 
the Kidney Tubule Expression Atlas. The renal tubuleâ€™s 14 distinct segments consist of epithelial cells with different transports and metabolic functions. Over the 44 samples analyzed, the average number of quantified proteins per segment was 4234, accounting for at least 99% of protein molecules in each cell, while the number of replicates range from 3 to 4. This represents a real condition of high-dimensional regime, 
and then our procedure has been applied in order to infer the conditional protein networks for each segment. With the aim to apply our algorithm, we removed, for each segment, all the proteins whose expression levels are zero in at least one sample.
