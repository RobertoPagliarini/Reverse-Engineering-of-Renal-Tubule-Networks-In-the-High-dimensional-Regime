# Reverse-Engineering-of-Renal-Tubule-Networks-In-the-High-dimensional-Regime

The mammalian renal tubule is made up of at least 14 segments, containing at least 16 distinct epithelial cell types. Each cell type has its own characteristic set of cellular functions, which have been elucidated largely over the past 50 years since the development of single-tubule microdissection approaches and the expansion of the micropuncture technique to mammalian physiology. New developments in protein mass spectrometry have resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity of protein detection and quantification. In this work, we point out our attention on the reverse-engineering of conditional networks for all the kidney tubule segments. We developed an algorithm rooted on Graphical Gaussian Models to infer proteomics conditional networks for all the kidney tubule segments, and we used these graphs to uncover new insights into how interaction networks are physically rewired in the different segments and/or stimuli.
